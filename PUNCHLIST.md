# PUNCHLIST — small fixes

Accumulated small fixes (not project-sized — those go to `docs/roadmap/`). Check items off
as done; keep newest context inline.

### [FIX-NOW] — concurrency races (multi-writer, real today)
From `docs/audits/single-user-assumptions-audit-2026-06-28.md` §1. NOT a commercial-tier
concern: Nemesis already runs 6 concurrent writer processes against one shared `alerts.db`,
so these read-modify-write races can bite with a single operator when the agent fleet checks
in concurrently. `get_db()` is autocommit + `busy_timeout` only — no multi-statement atomicity.
Fix each atomically, one at a time, audit-then-fix. The `ai_usage` `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO
UPDATE` (`modules/ai_engine/module.py`) is the in-repo template.

**✅ All four fixed atomically in `2d200e0` (Data Manager v0 seed, ADR 0006; Rule-6 backup
`alerts-PRE-DATAMGR-V0-20260628`).** Each labeled in code `# DATA MANAGER v0 — atomic
operation`. Anomaly used a *partial* `UNIQUE(offending_target) WHERE status='open'` (a plain
composite UNIQUE would also forbid multiple `closed` rows / break history). One residual
below.

- [x] **[FIX-NOW] `tickets_seq` duplicate ticket numbers.** `_next_ticket_number`
  (`modules/tickets/module.py:113-115`) does `SELECT next_number` then a separate
  `UPDATE … = next_number + 1` → two concurrent `open_ticket()` calls (e.g. auto-ticket-on-
  alert firing from alert-watcher + a module) get the same number. Fix: atomic
  `UPDATE tickets_seq SET next_number = next_number + 1 WHERE id=1 RETURNING next_number`
  (or equivalent single statement). **Highest-likelihood to surface during the trip.**

- [x] **[FIX-NOW] AI rate-limit counter lost increments.** `_increment_rate`
  (`modules/ai_engine/module.py:308-318`) reads `hour_count`/`day_count`, computes `+1`, writes
  back separately → concurrent calls lose increments and under-count the rate limit. Fix:
  atomic upsert like the `_increment_usage` sibling right below it.

- [x] **[FIX-NOW] `community_queue` duplicate rows.** `add_to_queue`
  (`modules/community_queue/module.py:110-135`) is SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE with no UNIQUE on
  `(domain_or_ip, submitted)` → concurrent detections create duplicate queue entries. Fix:
  add the UNIQUE constraint + `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.

- [x] **[FIX-NOW] `anomaly_incidents` duplicate open incidents.** `_create_or_update_incident`
  (`modules/anomaly_detection/module.py:654-705`) is SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE with no UNIQUE
  on `(offending_target, status)` → concurrent detections for one target create duplicate open
  incidents instead of merging. Fix: UNIQUE + atomic upsert (mind the time-window merge logic).

- [ ] **`anomaly_incidents` merge is still read-JSON→merge-Python→write (RACE 4 residual).**
  The `2d200e0` fix removed duplicate open incidents (partial unique index funnels concurrent
  detections into ONE incident), but the device-list merge in `_create_or_update_incident`
  (`modules/anomaly_detection/module.py`, `_merge_into`) still reads `devices_json`, merges in
  Python, and writes back — so *simultaneous* merges on the same target can drop device-list
  entries (lost update). **Low priority:** anomaly detection isn't highly concurrent per target
  in practice, and this is pre-existing (unchanged in kind from before `2d200e0`); it does NOT
  recreate duplicate incidents. Fix (one variable): wrap the read+merge+write in
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT` (this op owns a fresh `get_db()` connection, so serializing the
  merge is safe), or do the merge SQL-side (JSON1 / `json_*`) as a single atomic UPDATE.
  [ADR 0006 Data Manager — same atomic-operation seam.]

- [ ] **Header de-dup.** Remove the duplicated **Settings** / **Diagnostics** links from the
  upper-right corner — they also exist in the always-visible header. Frees the corner for the
  System Changes badge (`docs/roadmap/system-changes-badge.md`).

- [ ] **Kernel-update check.** Review `/var/log/apt/history.log` and confirm exactly what
  changed — a silent kernel update is the suspected *trigger* of the day-one VPN/DNS
  headaches. (NOT a root cause: the confirmed VPN/DNS root cause is PIA's killswitch +
  source-based policy routing — see ADR 0002. This item asks only *what changed on the box
  that day*; it's an open investigation, separate from that diagnosis.)

- [ ] **Stage-5 backup-purge (do during the backup rework).** When backup is reworked to a
  single SQLite-safe shared-DB snapshot, **remove the per-module-DB references** that back up
  dead fallback files (they won't exist after Stage 6):
  - `dashboard.py` `_backup_candidates()` (~line 4513) — the `modules/tickets/tickets.db` entry.
  - `install.sh` restore (~lines 1084–1089) — the `tickets.db` restore block.
  - backup help/description strings referencing `tickets.db`.

- [ ] **`PIHOLE_IP` hardcoded default (Rule 8 leak).** A personal LAN IP is shipped as a
  default — replace with `127.0.0.1` / read from `/etc/nemesis.env` (defaults must be correct
  for ANY user): `dashboard.py:65`, `diagnostics/pihole_health.py`, `modules/dhcp/module.py`.

- [ ] **`vpn-dns-guard.service` solves the wrong layer (keep/disable deferred to ADR 0005).**
  The unit is installed + running on this box but does **NOT fix** the DNS issue — the real
  cause is Pi-hole client-refusal-by-source, not upstream-blocking (see
  [ADR 0005](docs/architecture/0005-dns-firewall-device-auth-architecture.md), which
  supersedes ADR 0002's root cause). The guard reconciles a layer that was never broken.
  **Keep-or-disable decision is deferred to the ADR 0005 work.** Current workaround on this
  box = **VPN-off**. Also: the guard unit's **Rule-8 hardcoded absolute home path**
  (`core/vpn-dns-guard.service:12` `ExecStart` — a literal `/home/<user>/dashboard/...`)
  still needs parameterizing **before any public commit**.

- [ ] **Full hygiene sweep.** Repo-wide grep of the tracked tree for any other leaked secrets,
  home paths, real IPs, usernames. Known to triage: the `PIHOLE_IP` default above, the
  hardcoded support-destination email in `dashboard.py`, and the example SMTP hostnames in the
  SETUP docs / `install.sh`.

- [ ] **AI Settings: live Anthropic model pricing (replace hardcoded).** Replace the static
  hardcoded Anthropic pricing with LIVE pricing fetched from the Anthropic API (or a cached
  periodic fetch with a known-stale indicator). Static pricing becomes wrong the moment
  Anthropic changes it — and with dynamic/peak pricing likely coming, hardcoded values will
  actively mislead users about actual costs. The AI cost display is only trustworthy if it
  reflects real current pricing. **Fetch live, cache with TTL, show a staleness warning if the
  fetch fails.** Low priority until pricing volatility makes it urgent — but **future-proof the
  architecture now so it's a config change, not a rewrite.** Current hardcoded values live in
  `/etc/nemesis.env` (`ANTHROPIC_INPUT_PRICE_PER_MTOK` / `ANTHROPIC_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_MTOK`) and
  are surfaced in the AI cost UI (`dashboard.py` ~1661–1663, ~1753–1756).

- [ ] **Pi-hole unattended-install whiptail hang (fresh headless installs).** On a
  headless / no-display server, Pi-hole's installer still exits at a **static-IP whiptail
  notice** even on the non-interactive path — so Pi-hole never installs, and a later
  `uninstall.sh` then reports it "not installed." The `--unattended` call already sets
  `TERM=xterm` (`install.sh:587`), but the static-IP notice needs **pre-answering** (e.g.
  pre-seed `setupVars.conf` / pass the relevant non-interactive flag) so the installer
  doesn't block. Affects fresh installs on servers without a display. Found during the
  diagnostics VM audit 2026-06-28.

- [ ] **PRE-RELEASE: Full system-transparency audit.** Find every place Nemesis affects the
  user's system **without making it visible** — the black-box surfaces that erode trust,
  especially on shared machines. Read-only audit first (Rule 1): inventory + classify, then
  the `[ADD]` items become scoped pre-release work. **Same format as the readiness audit**
  (findings table → classification → fix list). Categories:
  - **Resource transparency** — CPU/memory/disk/network per service (the overhead meter,
    `docs/roadmap/nemesis-overhead-meter.md`).
  - **Action transparency** — every automated action logged and visible (ties to the
    multi-user `actor` seam — attributed, surfaced).
  - **Cost transparency** — live AI pricing, not stale estimates (subsumes the **live
    Anthropic pricing** punchlist item above — fold them together).
  - **Data transparency** — what's stored, where, and the retention policy (per ADR 0001
    shared `alerts.db` + each module's retention caps).
  - **Network transparency** — all outbound connections visible **and user-controlled**
    (relates to the firewall engine, ADR 0005).
  - **State transparency** — what each service is currently doing right now.
  - **Decision transparency** — why the AI said X, why an alert scored Y (surface the
    reasoning, not just the verdict).
  - Classify each finding as **[SAFE already visible]** / **[ADD pre-release]** / **[DEFER]**.
  **Scope:** one focused session (audit → classify → stop for review), to run before
  **v1.1 / commercial release**. The `[ADD]` items graduate to pre-release work.

- [ ] **Hardware monitor — Nemesis overhead meter.** Per-process CPU/memory for each Nemesis
  service (psutil, data already available). A "Nemesis overhead" section: total + per-service
  breakdown + memory-trend sparkline (leak detection). Transparency value: "Nemesis is using
  X% — not us." Could feed a `DEGRADED` verdict to the diagnostics watcher. (Full stub:
  `docs/roadmap/nemesis-overhead-meter.md`.)

- [ ] **Broken-API-endpoint self-healing.** When an AI/external API call fails with a
  connection/endpoint error (NOT auth), attempt to find + verify the correct current endpoint:
  (1) AI-assisted lookup (if the API is partially reachable); (2) web-search fallback (if raw
  egress works); (3) manual-guidance fallback (link to service docs). If found + verified →
  auto-update config → retry. Applies to all configured endpoints.

- [ ] **PRE-RELEASE: Documentation-completeness audit.** Every feature has docs; every vendor
  integration has a `CUSTOM_*.md`. Grep-verifiable.

- [ ] **PRE-RELEASE: Tiered-output audit.** Every client-facing output renders correctly at
  all three tiers. `tierText()` discipline verified end-to-end.

- [ ] **Recurring-user-error audit (ongoing research practice).** Skim help forums for each
  Nemesis component (Pi-hole, Suricata, ClamAV, VirtualBox, Tailscale, Ubuntu, r/selfhosted)
  for recurring error types. Classify: **DOCS / FEATURE / DESIGN.** First pass: alongside the
  pre-release audits. Ongoing: apply the same classification to first-party support tickets
  (`support@nemesis-sw.com`).

### v2/v3 captures — from the enterprise gap audit
Full analysis + priority in `docs/roadmap/enterprise-gap-audit-2026.md`. Listed here as a
working checklist (these are project-sized — they graduate to roadmap specs when scheduled).

- [ ] **MITRE ATT&CK mapping (v2).** Tag existing detections with tactic/technique/sub-technique.
  Canary trip = **T1486** (Data Encrypted for Impact). YARA rules can carry ATT&CK tags. Mostly
  labeling, not new detection. High professional credibility, medium effort.
- [ ] **Vulnerability management — basic (v2).** CVE check on installed packages + open-port
  exposure check + basic misconfiguration detection. Low–medium effort.
- [ ] **Auth/login monitoring via agent (v2).** PAM auth logging, SSH login events, sudo-usage
  tracking. Agent reports auth events to the dashboard. Low effort, high value.
- [ ] **Process-execution monitoring (v2/v3).** Extend psutil to track process spawning +
  parent-child relationships. Catches malware before it touches files (earlier kill chain than
  the canary).
- [ ] **Lateral-movement detection — core (promoted to v2).** Suricata + agent-data
  correlation: "unusual outbound from A to other fleet devices **after a detection on A**" =
  a query, not a new sensor. **Core (owned-fleet) version promoted to a v2 target** — simpler
  than the venue version (known fleet topology, owned devices, inputs already present). The
  **venue/epidemic spread** version remains a separate, later addition. (Stub:
  `docs/roadmap/lateral-movement-outbreak-detection.md`.)
- [ ] **Emergency backup on canary trip (v2).** Trigger the backup module on canary detection.
  Not full rollback, but "emergency backup before more files are encrypted."

- [ ] **Data Manager v0 follow-on — Race 4 residual merge-RMW.** `anomaly_incidents` device-list
  merge is still read-JSON → merge-in-Python → write under concurrent detections on the same
  target (the partial UNIQUE fix prevents duplicate incidents but doesn't atomicize the merge
  itself). Low priority in practice (anomaly detection isn't highly concurrent per target). Fix:
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` around the merge, or an SQL-side JSON merge. One variable. Follow-on to
  `2d200e0`.

- [ ] **Dashboard layout memory — server-side, two-level personalization.** Layouts must follow
  the user across devices (laptop → phone → tablet), so localStorage is wrong — store
  **server-side in `alerts.db` from day one**.
  - **Table:** `user_layouts (user_key TEXT, slot_name TEXT, slot_index 1-5, layout_json TEXT,
    updated_at TEXT, UNIQUE(user_key, slot_index))`.
  - **Layout JSON format (two levels):**
    ```json
    {
      "card_order": ["alerts", "hardware", "tickets", "diagnostics"],
      "card_content": {
        "hardware": ["cpu_temp", "fan_speed", "memory", "gpu_temp"],
        "alerts":   ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"],
        "tickets":  ["open", "investigating", "resolved"]
      }
    }
    ```
    - **Level 1 — card order:** which cards appear where on the dashboard.
    - **Level 2 — content order within cards:** which metrics/sections appear first inside each
      card. E.g. a hardware-monitor user may want `cpu_temp` first vs `fan_speed` first vs
      `memory` first — their priority, their order. Applies to: hardware monitor, alerts,
      tickets, diagnostics, malware card.
    - Same Sortable.js, same drag-and-drop, same storage — just applied at **two** levels
      instead of one.
  - **`user_key` evolution** (same table, value changes as identity matures): pre-session-identity
    → `request.remote_addr` (device-specific, functional); session identity (cookie display name)
    → display-name string (follows the user across devices — the trip-ready version); commercial
    auth → real user ID (secure, multi-tenant). Layout upgrades automatically as `user_key` matures.
  - **Layout slots:** 3–5 named slots per user (user-defined names: "Working", "Monitoring",
    "Incident Response", etc.), switchable instantly from a dashboard-header dropdown.
    "Reset to default" → tier-appropriate default layout.
  - **Draggable cards + draggable within-card sections:** Sortable.js (available via cdnjs, no
    new dependency).
  - **2 API routes:** `GET /api/layout` (load slots) + `POST /api/layout` (save slot).
  - **Build-order dependency:** session identity must land **before** layout memory so layouts
    are globally available per-user from day one. Full build order: race fixes ✅ → actor
    attribution → session identity → dashboard layout memory (two-level).
  - **Principle:** *"this feels like my tool"* — what keeps a product in daily use. Layout memory
    at both the card and metric level is complete personalization for the non-expert user who
    builds a specific mental map of where things are.

- [ ] **Dashboard header status lights — global green/amber/red health indicator.** Always
  visible in the header regardless of the current layout — this **solves the layout-memory
  blind-spot**: a user's preferred layout may have the alerts card off-screen, but the header is
  always visible. Three states:
  - **GREEN (●):** all clear — no unacknowledged critical/high alerts, all services healthy,
    canary clean, nothing awaiting action.
  - **AMBER (▲):** attention when convenient — medium alerts, open tickets, degraded (not down)
    services.
  - **RED (■):** action needed now — unacknowledged CRITICAL/HIGH alerts, service down, canary
    trip unresolved, quarantine awaiting confirmation, diagnostics LOCAL_FAIL.
  - **Display:** leftmost header element, color + shape (colorblind-friendly), optional count
    badge (`🔴 3` = 3 things need attention). Clicking jumps to the alerts/tickets view
    regardless of current layout — the "one click to what needs attention" shortcut.
  - **Data sources** (aggregated into one `/api/header/status` verdict): alert severity
    (unacknowledged CRITICAL/HIGH → red); service health (any down → red, degraded → amber);
    diagnostics watcher verdict (LOCAL_FAIL → red, DEGRADED → amber); canary state (unresolved
    trip → red); quarantine state (awaiting confirmation → red).
  - **Polling:** `GET /api/header/status` every 30s (existing `setInterval` pattern), returns
    `{status: 'red'|'amber'|'green', counts: {critical, high, services_down}}`. Count badge shown
    when non-zero.
  - **Tiered tooltip:** same light for all tiers; hover detail is tiered (Beginner: plain language
    "3 alerts need your attention"; Pro: specific counts and states).
  - **Professional value:** makes the product look/feel built by people who thought about how it
    gets *used*, not just how it *works*. Universal signal — no expertise required to understand a
    green vs red light.
  - **Build order:** independent of session identity and layout memory — can be built any time.
    Small: one API route + one 30s polling interval + header HTML/CSS. High visibility, low effort.
