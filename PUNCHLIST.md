# PUNCHLIST — small fixes

Accumulated small fixes (not project-sized — those go to `docs/roadmap/`). Check items off
as done; keep newest context inline.

- [ ] **Header de-dup.** Remove the duplicated **Settings** / **Diagnostics** links from the
  upper-right corner — they also exist in the always-visible header. Frees the corner for the
  System Changes badge (`docs/roadmap/system-changes-badge.md`).

- [ ] **Kernel-update check.** Review `/var/log/apt/history.log` and confirm exactly what
  changed — a silent kernel update is the suspected cause of the day-one VPN/DNS headaches.

- [ ] **Stage-5 backup-purge (do during the backup rework).** When backup is reworked to a
  single SQLite-safe shared-DB snapshot, **remove the per-module-DB references** that back up
  dead fallback files (they won't exist after Stage 6):
  - `dashboard.py` `_backup_candidates()` (~line 4513) — the `modules/tickets/tickets.db` entry.
  - `install.sh` restore (~lines 1084–1089) — the `tickets.db` restore block.
  - backup help/description strings referencing `tickets.db`.

- [ ] **`PIHOLE_IP` hardcoded default (Rule 8 leak).** A personal LAN IP is shipped as a
  default — replace with `127.0.0.1` / read from `/etc/nemesis.env` (defaults must be correct
  for ANY user): `dashboard.py:65`, `diagnostics/pihole_health.py`, `modules/dhcp/module.py`.

- [ ] **Full hygiene sweep.** Repo-wide grep of the tracked tree for any other leaked secrets,
  home paths, real IPs, usernames. Known to triage: the `PIHOLE_IP` default above, the
  hardcoded support-destination email in `dashboard.py`, and the example SMTP hostnames in the
  SETUP docs / `install.sh`.
